This is a project I did for algorithms class in college. It is an implementation of SHA1 and PARSHA-256 algorithms
on GPU. I believe that PARSHA-256 has some bugs due to byte ordering.

Compilation: cd src && make
Execution:
	./sha1test		- SHA-1 performance test
	./parsha256test		- PARSHA-256 performance test on GPU
	./parsha256testemu	- PARSHA-256 performance test on CPU (emulation mode)
